# Crowdfunding_Grp_A2


This project offers a decentralised and secure crowd funding network that is built on the blockchain. The main objective of this project is to create smart contracts that enable contributors to efficiently make and reserve funds for the project while also giving investors control over the money they invest. This will enable investors to successfully contribute to any project.
